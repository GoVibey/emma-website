## Lead Magnet #1: "The Cancer-Free Mindset: 7 Daily Practices for Healing Beyond Treatment"

### Format: PDF Guide (12-15 pages)

### Landing Page Copy

**Headline:**
Your treatment ended. Your healing hasn't.

**Subheadline:**
7 daily practices that helped me — and hundreds of others — rebuild life after cancer. Free guide.

**Body:**
When the doctors say "you're cancer-free," everyone celebrates. But nobody tells you what comes next.

The fear that comes back at 3 AM. The exhaustion that doesn't go away. The strange guilt of surviving. The loneliness of people who "don't get it."

I'm Emma, and I've been exactly where you are.

After my own cancer journey, I discovered that healing isn't just what happens in the hospital — it's what happens every morning when you wake up and choose how to face the day.

This free guide shares the 7 daily practices that transformed my recovery — and that I've since taught to hundreds of cancer survivors around the world.

**What's inside:**
- ✅ The morning ritual that rewires fear into presence (takes 5 minutes)
- ✅ How to handle the "but you look fine" conversations
- ✅ The one journaling prompt that changed everything for me
- ✅ A simple breathing technique for scan anxiety
- ✅ How to rebuild your identity beyond "cancer patient"
- ✅ The community secret — why healing alone is so much harder
- ✅ Your first 30-day healing roadmap

## Lead Magnet #2: "Scan Anxiety Survival Kit: What to Do Before, During & After Your Follow-Up"

### Format: One-page printable + 3-email sequence

### Landing Page Copy

**Headline:**
Your next scan is coming. Let's get through it together.

**Subheadline:**
The practical, emotional toolkit every cancer survivor needs before their follow-up appointment. Free download.

**Body:**
If your heart races just looking at your calendar and seeing that scan date circled — you're not alone. And you're not overreacting.

Scan anxiety (sometimes called "scanxiety") affects the vast majority of cancer survivors. It's one of the most common — and least talked about — parts of life after cancer.

I've been there. Hands shaking in the waiting room. Unable to sleep the night before. Crying in the car afterward — even when the results were good.

This kit isn't about "thinking positive." It's about having real tools ready when the anxiety hits.

**What you'll get:**
- 📋 **Pre-scan checklist** — what to do the week before (practical + emotional)
- 🧘 **Waiting room toolkit** — breathing exercises and grounding techniques you can do silently
- 💬 **Scripts for hard conversations** — what to say to your doctor, your partner, yourself
- 📧 **3-day email series** — Day before, Day of, Day after — we'll be with you through it

**CTA Button:** Get the Scanxiety Kit →

**Trust element:** "Created by a cancer survivor, for cancer survivors. Because we know."

**Email capture:** First name + Email + "When is your next scan?" (optional — triggers personalized email timing)

## Lead Magnet #3: "Cancer Changed Everything: A Journal for the Things Nobody Talks About"

### Format: Printable journal/workbook (20 pages)

### Landing Page Copy

**Headline:**
The things you can't say out loud? Write them here.

**Subheadline:**
A guided journal for cancer survivors — for the grief, the anger, the hope, and everything in between. Free download.

**Body:**
After cancer, people want you to be grateful. Strong. Positive. Inspiring.

But what about the days when you're angry? The days when you're terrified it's coming back? The days when you feel guilty for being alive when others aren't?

Nobody gives you permission to feel those things. This journal does.

"Cancer Changed Everything" is a guided journal created specifically for people navigating life after a cancer diagnosis. It's not a gratitude journal (though gratitude is in there). It's not a wellness tracker (though your body matters). It's a space for the full truth of your experience.

Every prompt was written by someone who's been there. Every page is a reminder that your feelings — all of them — are part of healing.

**What's inside:**
- 📝 30 guided journal prompts (one per day)
- 💭 Prompts for fear, grief, anger, hope, identity, relationships, and purpose
- 🪞 Self-reflection exercises from Emma's coaching practice
- 🌱 Space for "micro-victories" — the small wins nobody else notices
- 💬 Quotes from real cancer survivors in our community

**Trust element:** "Used by 300+ members of our cancer healing community. Your story matters."
