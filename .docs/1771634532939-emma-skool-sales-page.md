## Sales Page Structure

---

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
You Don't Have to Navigate Cancer Alone

**Subheadline:**
Join a community of survivors, fighters, and supporters who understand exactly what you're going through — led by someone who's been there.

**CTA Button:** Join the Community →

### The Problem (Empathy Section)

**Headline:** The Loneliest Journey

When you hear the word "cancer," everything changes. Suddenly you're navigating a world of doctors, treatments, decisions, and emotions that nothing could have prepared you for.

Your family tries to help, but they don't fully understand. Your friends don't know what to say. Google gives you information — but information isn't support.

**What you actually need is:**
- Someone who's been through it and came out the other side
- A community that gets it — no explanations needed
- Practical guidance, not just medical jargon
- Hope that isn't naive, but grounded in real experience

That's exactly why Ima Wile exists.

She's not here to sell you hope. She's here to walk beside you.

### FAQ Section

**Q: Is this a medical support group?**
A: No. Ima Wile is an educational and emotional support community. We don't provide medical advice. Always consult your healthcare team for medical decisions. What we do provide is a space to share experiences, learn from each other, and find strength in community.

**Q: Do I have to share my story?**
A: Absolutely not. You can participate as much or as little as you're comfortable with. Some members are very active; others prefer to read and absorb. Both are welcome.

**Q: What if I'm not tech-savvy?**
A: Skool is one of the simplest platforms out there. If you can use Facebook, you can use this. And if you need help, just ask — our community is supportive by nature.

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes. Premium membership can be cancelled anytime. No contracts, no commitments beyond the current month.

**Q: Is the content in English or Hebrew?**
A: [Confirm with Emma — likely both, or primarily one with plans for the other]

**Q: How is this different from a Facebook group?**
A: Facebook groups are full of noise, ads, and algorithms. Skool is a dedicated, distraction-free space built specifically for communities like ours. Plus, Premium members get access to structured courses and live calls that Facebook can't offer.

### Final CTA Section

**Headline:** You've Already Shown Incredible Strength. Now Let Us Walk With You.

Cancer changes everything. But it doesn't have to change you alone.

Join a community that understands, supports, and empowers — without judgment, without pressure, without pretending it's easy.

Because it's not easy. But it's easier together.
